Integration with Zendesk
========================

Integration with Zendesk
========================

OroCRM supports out of the box integration with Zendesk.
The integration enables loading the data from your Zendesk account and processing it in the OroCRM.
This article describes how to define and edit the integration and synchronization settings.

.. hint::

    While Zendesk integration capabilities are pre-implemented, OroCRM can be integrated with different third-party
    systems.


On the Zendesk Side
-------------------

The only thing you will need on the Zendesk side, is to get your API token:

- Open your account and go to the *Admin* page.

- Go to the CHANNELS → API

.. image:: ./img/zendesk/zendesk_api.png

- Make sure the *Token Access* is enabled
- Copy an active API token

On the Oro Side
---------------

Create Zendesk Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Go to the *"System → Integrations → Manage Integrations"* and click the :guilabel:`Create Integration` button.

- The "Create Integration" form will appear. 

- As soon as you've set the integration type to "Zendesk", the form will be recalculated to meet specific integration 
  requirements.

General
"""""""

Define the following mandatory details in the *"General"* section:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Type***","The integration type. Shall be set to *Zendesk*
  "**Name***","The integration name used to refer to it within the system."
  "**URL***","A URL of your Zendesk account (e.g. https://username.zendesk.com)."
  "**API Email***","The email used to register your Zendesk account."
  "**API Token***","The API token generated and/or copied on the Zendesk side as described above."
  "**Default Zendesk User Email**","The email used for the :ref:`default Zendesk user in OroCRM`."
  "**Owner**",""**Owner***","Limits the list of users that can manage the integration to users, whose roles allow 
  managing integration assigned to the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, 
  etc.).
  
  By default, the user creating the integration is chosen."
  

.. _user-guide-zendesk-channel-integration-synchronization:

Synchronization Settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use the *Synchronization Settings* section to enable/disable two way synchronization.

Check *Enable Two Way Sync* box, if you want to download data both from Zendesk to OroCRM and
back. If the box is unchecked, data from Zendesk will be loaded to OroCRM, but changes performed in OroCRM will not be
loaded to Zendesk.

If the two-way synchronization is enabled, define the priority used for the conflict resolution (e.g. if the same
customer details were edited from the both OroCRM and Zendesk):

- *Remote wins*: Zendesk data will be applied to the both Zendesk and OroCRM

- *Local wins*: OroCRM data will be applied to the both Zendesk and OroCRM

For example we have created a Demo Zendesk Integration with enabled two-way synchronization, where if the same data
has been changed from the both Zendesk and OroCRM, the Zendesk changes will take precedence.

.. _user-guide-Zendesk-channel-integration-details_edit:

Activate the Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initially the integration is inactive. In order to activate it, click the Activate button in the  
:ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>`.

Edit the Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the integrations created will be available in the Integrations grid under the *"System → Integrations → Manage 
Integrations"*. Use the :ref:`grid action icon <user-guide-ui-components-grid-action-icons>` to delete (|IcDelete|) or 
edit (|IcEdit|) the integration details.

.. _user-guide-Zendesk-channel-start-synchronization:

Synchronization
---------------

Once integration has been created, the data will be automatically synchronized. However, you can also start the
synchronization manually from OroCRM:

- Go to the System → Integrations → Manage Integrations and click the |BSchedule|
  :ref:`grid action icon <user-guide-ui-components-grid-action-icons>` or

- Go to the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the :guilabel:`Schedule Sync` button. 
  *A sync* :ref:`job <book-job-execution>` *has been added to the queue.   Check progress.* note will appear.

- The data is being synchronized. You can click *Check progress* link to see the synchronization status.

After the successful synchronization: 

- Details of the Zendesk tickets will be mapped to details of cases in OroCRM.
- Details of the OroCRM cases will be mapped to the details of Zendesk tickets (if the two-way synchronization is 
  enabled).
- If some ticket details of a Zendesk ticket have been changed after the initial synchronization, the corresponding 
  OroCRM case details will also be update.
- If some ticket details of an OroCRM case have been changed after the initial synchronization, the corresponding 
  Zendesk ticket details will also be updated (if the two-way synchronization is enabled).
- If the same details have been updated in a related Zendesk ticket and OroCRM case and the two-way synchronization is 
  enabled, the synchronization priority settings will be applied.
