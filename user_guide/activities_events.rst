Add and Assign Calendar Events
==============================

Calendar events represent different meetings, conferences and other arrangements.  

Create an Event
---------------
There are several ways to create an event:

- Add an event for a related entity record and define the users-participants.

- Assign an event directly to the user and add other users-participants.

- Create an event from the Events grid and add other users-participants.

Add an Event for a Related Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Add Event* action will be available for records of entities with "Calendar Events" activity 
:ref:`enabled <user-guide-activities-enable>`.

1. Open the View page of a record the event is related to.

2. Click :guilabel:`Add Event` in the :ref:`actions <user-guide-ui-components-view-page-actions>` tab.

3. The "Add Event" form will appear. The form has the following fields:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Title***","The event name. Must be defined."
  "**Start***","The time of the event start. Must be specified." 
  "**End***","The time of the event end. Must be specified."
  "**All day event**","The check-box to define if the event is of all-day nature."
  "**Color**","Defines the color to be used in the user's calendar."
  "**Guests**","Defines users, for whom the event is created. Choose the user records from the drop-down. Any amount 
  of users can be chosen."
  "**Reminders**","Defines if a message must be sent to the users defined in the *Guests* field before the event.
  Click the :guilabel:`Add` button to add a reminder.

  - Define if the message shall be an email or a flash message and how long before the time defined in the *Start* it
    shall be sent."

For example, we want Ellen Rowell from the sales and Michael Buckley from the marketing to be present at the meeting 
with a new contact from the Cal Stereo company. We have chose red color to display the event in the users' calendars.

4. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button and the event will be added.


Assign an Event to a User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to the View page of the user record, for which the event is assigned.

2. Click :guilabel:`Assign Event` in the :ref:`actions <user-guide-ui-components-view-page-actions>` tab of the user.

3. The "Assign Event to {user name}" form will appear.

   The form has the same fields as the "Add Event" form. The "Guest" field in this case relates to the guests other than
   the user and may be left empty. 

For example, we also need Ellen Rowell to visit a sales conference on the eights of April.

4. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button and the event will be saved.


Create an Event from the Events Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to the *Activities â†’ Calendar Events*.

.. hint:

    Another way to get to the grid is to click the :guilable`Events` button above your calendar.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Create Calendar Event` button.

3. The "Create Calendar Event" form will appear.

.. image:: ./img/activities/create_event.png


The form has the same fields as the "Add Event" form. The "Guest" field relates to the guests other than
the user and may be left empty.


View and Manage Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:

   The ability to view and edit the events depends on specific roles and permissions defined for them in 
   the system. 
   
- All the events  added  for a record are displayed and can be reached from the *Record Activities* section on the 
  View page:

.. image:: ./img/activities/add_event_view.png

- To see the details, click on the event title or the :guilabel:`+` to the left from it.  

.. image:: ./img/activities/add_event_view_detailed.png


- All your calendar events assigned to you are displayed and can be reached from the Events grid.

- In order to see the events assigned to another user on the Events grid:
  
  - Go to "My Calendar".

.. image:: ./img/activities/assign_events_cal.png  

- Choose the user in the drop-down on the left.

.. image:: ./img/activities/assign_events_cal_add.png  

- From any of the grids above, you can manage the events using the action icons:

  - Delete the task: |IcDelete|

  - Get to the :ref:`Edit from <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` of the event: |IcEdit|

  - Get to the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the event:  |IcView|

- You can also manage your events from the calendar:

  - Click on the task in the calendar to get to its information tab. 
  
  - Use the buttons at the bottom to manage the task.
