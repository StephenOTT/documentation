Access and Permissions Management
=================================

Ownership Types
---------------

Each entity in OroCRM has an :ref:`ownership type <user-guide-entity-management-create-other>` type, which defines the 
level at which permissions will be set for records of the entity.

If the ownership type is set to "None", no authorization is required to see and process the entity and all the users
within the OroCRM instance will be able to view, create, edit, delete and assign records of the entity. 

If the ownership type is Organization, Business Unit or User, the owner of the entity records is an Organization,
Business Unit or User correspondingly, and the rights to view, create, edit, delete and assign records of the entity
depend on the specific Role settings, as described in the following section. 

.. _user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles:

Roles
-----
Each OroCRM user must be assigned a role. The role defines a set of permissions and access rights that 
will be applied to all the users, who have been assigned this role.
One user may have several roles. All the permissions granted to at least one of the roles, are granted to the user. 

If the ownership type of an entity is set to a User / Business Unit / Organization ability to see and process the entity
records is defined by the role(s) assigned to the user.


*Creating a Role*
-----------------

To create a new role:

- Go to *System → User Management → Roles*
- Click the :guilabel:`Create Role` button
  
  |role_create|

- In the form emerged, define the role name that will be used to assign the role to a user and other settings as 
  described in the following sections:
  
  - ***Entity***: define what permissions the users assigned this role will have for the entity records with ownership
    type other than "None"
  - ***Capabilities***: define if the user assigned this role will have access to certain parts of the system
  - ***Users***: select Users to be assigned this role
