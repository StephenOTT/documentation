OroCRM Activities
=================

An important part of a successful customer relations process is clear and timely communication between all the 
stakeholders. OroCRM's activities enable creation, tracking and ongoing update of customer-related activities such as 
phone calls, emails, tasks, calendar events, etc. Each activity can be processed in the system, subject to the 
predefined logics. 

In the course of customization, new activities can be created and their logics can be defined, subject to your specific 
business needs. Follow the links to learn more about the following activities available in OroCRM out-of-the-box:

- :ref:`Send Email <user-guide-activities-emails>`: generate an Email with predefined properties related to the record.  

- :ref:`Log Call <user-guide-activities-calls>`: keep track of all the calls related to the record.
