Call and Email Using Hangouts 
=============================
With the Hangouts feature you can call via Google Hangouts directly from OroCRM. 
This means that sales team can make calls to your customers and prospects directly from OroCRM, making it faster than 
ever to make and log your sales calls.
The feature is also great for support teams, as they can contact the customer and utilize the screen sharing function 
for necessary support cases.
It can be used for internal communications (meetings and discussions), as it is possible to hold a session with up to 
five OroCRM users. Moreover, integration with OroCRM Calendar, allows to pre-arrange a meeting and then quickly launch 
a call from the event page.
