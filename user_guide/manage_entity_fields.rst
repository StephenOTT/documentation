Manage Entity Fields
====================

The following actions are available from the fields grid in a View page of an 
entity `<user-guide-entity-management-edit>`:

.. image:: ./img/entity_management/new_entity_field_edit.png
  
- Remove a field: click |icDelete|. The action is available only for custom entities
  
- Click |IcEdit| to get directly to the entity edit form

  All the properties of custom fields but their name and type may be edited. The properties are the same as when 
  you :ref:`create a field <user-guide-entity-management-create-fields>`.

  The list of properties editable for System fields depends on configuration and is created in a way reasonable and safe 
  for the system performance and operation.
