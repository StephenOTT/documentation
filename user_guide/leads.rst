Leads
=====

In order to save and process the details of commercial activity with  people or businesses that have  authority, budget 
and interest to purchase goods  and/or services from you, for whom the probability of actual sales is not yet high or 
is impossible to define, use the The *"Lead"* records in OroCRM ("leads").
Initial agreement discussions, preliminary price requests or invitations for a bid may be examples of a lead. 

In order to save and process details of different leads in OroCRM, you need to have at least one 
:term:`Channel`, for which the *"Lead"* entity :ref:`is assigned <user-guide-channel-guide-entities>`.

.. _user-guide-leads-create:

Create Lead Records
-------------------

- Go to the *Sales → Leads*

- Click :guilabel:`Create Lead` button

- The *Create Lead* :ref:`form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` will appear:

  |

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_create.png

| 

The following fields are mandatory and **must** be defined:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Owner***","Limits the list of users that can manage the lead to users,  whose 
  :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` allow managing 
  leads assigned to the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.).
  
  By default, the user creating the record is chosen."
  "**Lead Name***","The name used to refer to the lead in the system."
  "**Channel***","Choose one of active :term:`channels <Channel>`, from which OroCRM will get information on this lead."
  "**First Name*** and **Last Name***","Personal details of the potential customer or contact person." 

The rest of the fields are optional. They have been added to the system based on the general B2B practices and keep 
additional details about the lead (such as the website, name of related :term:`B2B customer <B2B Customer>`, industry, 
address details, etc.). The optional fields may be left empty.

.. hint::

    If you need to record and process any other details of your leads, :ref:`custom fields can be created <user-guide-field-management-create>`. Custom fields are displayed in the *Additional* section.

Once all the necessary fields have been defined, click the button in the right top corner of the page to save the lead
in the system.


.. _user-guide-leads-actions:

Manage Lead Records 
-------------------

The following actions can be performed for the leads:

From the :ref:`grid <user-guide-ui-components-grids>`:

      |

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_grid.png

|

- Export and import lead record details with :guilabel:`Export` and :guilabel:`Import` buttons as described in the 
  :ref:`Export and Import Functionality <user-guide-import>` guide. 
  
- Delete a lead from the system: |IcDelete|
  
- Get to the :ref:`Edit form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` of the lead: |IcEdit|
  
- Get to the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the lead: |IcView| 
  
      |
  
From the View page you can:
  
- Get to the *"Edit"* form of the lead.

- Delete the lead from the system 
  
- The rest of the actions available depend on the system settings defined in the 
  :ref:`Communication &  Collaboration settings <user-guide-entity-management-create-commun-collab>`
  of the Lead entity
      

.. _user-guide-leads-reports:

Reports with Lead Records
-------------------------

OroCRM provides a ready-to-use *Leads by Date* report.

Leads by Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simple but useful report, where you can see how many leads were created on a specific date for 
all of your channels.

In order to see the report, go to *Reports and Segments → Reports → Leads → Leads By Date*

It shows:

- the date leads were created on 

- the number of the leads created on the date, and 

- total amount of the leads created

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_report_by_date.png

|

New custom reports can be added. For more details on the ways to create and 
customize the reports, see the :ref:`Reports guide <user-guide-reports>`.


.. _user-guide-leads-workflows:

Using Leads in the Workflows
----------------------------

You can use OroCRM's :term:`workflows <Workflow>` to define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates of Leads 
in the system. 

OroCRM comes with a pre-implemented B2B-oriented :ref:`Sales Processes Workflow <user-guide-sales-processes>`. 

New customer-specific workflows can also be created, as described in the 
:ref:`Workflows guide <user-guide-workflow-management-basics>`.
